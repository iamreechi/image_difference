# image_difference

This file make use of a library skimage and a function there as  SSIM to spot difference between two images.

The script detects where the difference in both images are and draws a bounding box around it 


SSIM means (Structural Similarity Index) SSIM uses -1 to 1 to measure difference. A score of 1 meant they are very similar and a score of -1 meant they are very different
